#. How to get this device ? 


	We appreciate your interest, if you are a student from India you  will get it soon. Already more than 20k devices have been shipped to different colleges, please don't raise any questions regarding availability


#. Can I run unity desktop ?


	In ``Ubuntu 12.04`` builds you can actually install ``unity-2d-panel`` but it will be very less resposive compared to 
	the custom lxde version which comes default with this device. The team is considering Ubuntu 12.10 because of many
	stability issues in lxde, in that case ``unity-2d`` will not be available.

#. Will it run from internal NAND flash ? How it will affect my stock android ?


	It may run from internal NAND flash, but for now we are concentrating only on sdcard version. The Linux boots directly
	from sdcard without touching any android filesystem from NAND 


#. How to contribute ?

	Write to us, you can do lot of fancy stuff like building custom apps, fixing bugs, cross compiling, writing good documents, manuals etc
